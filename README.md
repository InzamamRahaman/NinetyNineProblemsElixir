NinetyNineProblemsElixir
==

The classical 99 problems originally developed to assist students to learn the Prolog programming
language has become a standard way to introduce oneself to the pecularities of how particular languages
implement functional and logic programming. Using these 99 problems I hope to get a better grasp and appreciation
of the Elixir programming language
